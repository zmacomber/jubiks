**jubiks** is just a rubiks cube solver written in java. 
One just needs to supply the starting cube colors and then jubiks 
should be able to display the necessary moves to solve it.

The colors of each square should be supplied top to bottom, left to right in the following face order:
front, right, back, left, top & bottom.

Cube rotation is based on the front face.

It's a WIP for now. 

Run instructions will be posted when it's ready.
